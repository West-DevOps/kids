Notes / guides for kids wanting to learn a bit more programming

## Which way do you want to go?

* More games / scratch-like? (block based development)
* "Proper" programming (text based / learning a language)

Choosing a language is a very hard thing, it mostly depends on what you want to do with your skills! 
Some are easy to learn, some are very hard however all of them will give you the skills to engineer your way 
out of almost any problem with a computer! 

Most programmers start with an easy "high-level" language

## Some programming languages

Real easy to learn (high level languages): 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Easy to learn and powerful (my daily driver as well), used widely in the engineering and AI / machine learning spaces.  Not as common for a first language though!
* [JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/en) Most common for a first language for many (especially kids).  Simple to learn and flexible. Used on all websites.  A lot of games are written in this too, some examples: 
  * [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) a 100% javascript game
  * [Scratch](https://github.com/scratchfoundation) itself is written in JavaScript! 
* [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.4) This is a windows only language but comes pre-installed on every windows machine
* [UNIX Shell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/) For programming on unix/linux systems.  Uncommon on end-user machines but nearly all servers on the planet run this operating system.

A bit harder to learn: 
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) Very common server-side in websites and a lot of apps/games use it.  

Hard to learn (low level languages):

These are what other programming languages are written in.  Like _python_ is written mostly in _C_.  These languages 
compile down to raw machine code and are incredibly fast.  Generally, if absolute performance is required you
will choose one of the many "low-level" languages over a high level one. 

* [C](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) Difficult to learn, considered an "O.G" language as it has been around
since 1972! Operating systems (like windows and linux) are mostly written in this.  
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) New low-level kid on the block (first seen in 2015!).  

I would avoid a "low-level" language as your first as they have some very hard concepts that you need to learn
before you can write good code in them.  

For an absolute beginner `JavaScript` has probably the widest application as it is transferable across nearly every
computer on earth and has a pretty shallow learning curve of all languages (that I know). 

## Some tutorial websites

This one is good as it has tutorials for almost _every_ programming language that is 
commonly used on the web today.  But it's probably quite overwhelming for someone starting out: 
> [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

Found this one which looks like it's good for learning `JavaScript` for kids: 
> [kidJs](https://kidjs.app/)

Good intro to `JavaScript` (more a read for the parent):
