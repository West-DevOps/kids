Notes / guides for kids wanting to learn a bit more programming

## Which way do you want to go?

* More games / scratch-like?
* "Proper" programming (learning a language)

## Some programming languages 

Choosing a language is a very hard thing, it mostly depends on what you want to do! some are easier to learn some very hard.  
All of them will give you the skills to engineer your way out of almost any problem.  Here are some I know 


Real easy to learn (high level languages): 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Easy to learn and powerful, used widely in the engineering and AI / machine learning spaces.  not as common for a first language though!
* [JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/en) Most common for a first language for many.  Simple to learn and flexible. Used on all websites.  A lot of games are written in this too, some examples: 
  * [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) a 100% javascript game
  * [Scratch](https://github.com/scratchfoundation) itself is written in JavaScript! 

A bit harder to learn: 
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) Very common server-side in websites and a lot of apps/games use it.  

Hard to learn (low level languages):

These are what other programming languages are written in.  Like _python_ is written mostly in _C_.

* [C](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) Difficult... Operating systems (like windows and linux) are written in this though! 
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) Again hard to learn as it's very low-level but here lies the most powerful languages! 

For an absolute beginner `JavaScript` has probably the widest application for writing games. 

## Some tutorial websites

This one is good as it has tutorials for almost _every_ programming language that is 
commonly used today.  But it's probably quite overwhelming for someone starting out:
